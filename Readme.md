## Outdated Documentation

Please note that the documentation and this README are not up to date. We‚Äôve made significant changes to Leon over the past few months, including the introduction of new TTS and ASR engines, and a hybrid approach that balances LLM, simple classification, and multiple NLP techniques to achieve optimal speed, customization, and accuracy. We‚Äôll update the documentation for the official release.

## Project History and Future Plans

Since its inception in 2017, Leon has undergone significant transformations. Although we‚Äôve been inconsistent in shipping updates over the years, we‚Äôre now focused on maturing the project. With the recent integration of transformers-based models, we‚Äôre prepared to unlock Leon‚Äôs full potential.

Our next step is to finalize the latest features for the official release. Then we‚Äôll be establishing a group of active contributors to work together, develop new skills, and share them with the community. A skill registry platform will be built (see it as the npm or pip registry but for skills).

While I would love to devote more time to Leon, I‚Äôm currently unable to do so because I have bills to pay. I have some ideas about how to monetize Leon in the future (Leon‚Äôs core will always remain open source), but before getting there, there is still a long way to go.

Until then, any financial support by [sponsoring Leon](#) is much appreciated üôÇ

## Introduction

Leon is an open-source personal assistant who can live on your server.

### Why?

1. If you are a developer (or not), you may want to build many things that could help in your daily life.  
   Instead of building a dedicated project for each of those ideas, Leon can help you with his Skills structure.

2. With this generic structure, everyone can create their own skills and share them with others.  
   Therefore there is only one core (to rule them all).

3. Leon uses AI concepts, which is cool.

4. Privacy matters; you can configure Leon to talk with him offline.  
   You can already text with him without any third-party services.

5. Open source is great.
